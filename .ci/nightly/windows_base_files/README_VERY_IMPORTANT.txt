HOW TO RUN:

if you have a NVIDIA gpu:

run_nvidia_gpu.bat



To run it in slow CPU mode:

run_cpu.bat



IF YOU GET A RED ERROR IN THE UI MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A MODEL/CHECKPOINT IN: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints

You can download the stable diffusion 1.5 one from: https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt



RECOMMENDED WAY TO UPDATE:
To update only the ComfyUI code: update\update_comfyui_only.bat



To update ComfyUI with the python dependencies (ONLY USE IF YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE PYTHON PACKAGES): update\update_all.bat
